# coin-detection
detect coin in a scene

## To-Do

1. Determine model(probably CNN)
    * Fourier transform, region-based histogram equalization, GMM, HMM, kNN, SVM, ANN, PCA, RBM, CNN, RNN 
2. Detect which functions need to be implemented
    * cvtColor  
    * GaussianBlur
    * Canny 
    * dilate - make edges clear
    * findContours, drawContours
    * CNN
3. Define function signature, and decide who implements what
